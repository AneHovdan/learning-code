# Background
The code in this repo is meant for experimenting and learning basic programming, with emphasis on containers, messagebrokers, data visualisation and git as a bonus. Some of the sources that are used are strava.com, yr.no and nilu.no. InfluxDB is used to store the data, Grafana to visualize the data and Mosquitto to move data across the containers. The scripts that interacts with the data sources are all python. Everything runs in docker containers. The code is tested on Raspberry Pi 4b.

**All comments, suggestions and pull requests to improve the code is very welcome!
